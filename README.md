Syrinx is an open source and modular method of converting analog resistances to digital floats using a raspberry pi

<br /><b>main.py</b> is the main patch<br />
<br /><b>send.py</b> is to send the resistances over a server<br />
<br /><b>receive.py</b> is to receive those floats<br />
<br /><b>PiAnalog.py</b>is a fork of MONK MAKES PiAnalog. This was modified to allow for more than one set of GPIO pins to be used to measure analog resistances
