Syrinx is an open source and modular method of converting analog resistances to digital floats using a raspberry pi

<br />main.py is the main patch<br />
<br />send.py is to send the resistances over a server<br />
<br />receive.py is to receive those floats<br />
<br />PiAnalog.py is a fork of MONK MAKES PiAnalog. This was modified to allow for more than one set of GPIO pins to be used to measure analog resistances
